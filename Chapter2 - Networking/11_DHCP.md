# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

## Definition: DHCP
- DHCP allows a host to obtain an IP address automatically.
- Besides, DHCP also allows a host to learn additional information, such as its subnet mask, the default gateway, the address of the local DNS server.

## How does DHCP work?
For a newly arriving host, the DHCP is a four-step process. 
- DHCP server discovery
- DHCP server offer(s) 
- DHCP request
- DHCP ACK
