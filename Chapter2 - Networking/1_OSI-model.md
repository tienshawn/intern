- Developed by ISO - 'International Organization for Standardization', in the year 1984.
- Acts as a reference framework that explains the process of transmitting data between computers.


### Consists of 7 layers, including:
- [1. Physical Layer](#1-physical-layer)
- [2. Data link Layer](#2-datalink-layer)
- [3. Network Layer](#3-network-layer)
- [4. Transport Layer](#4-transport-layer)
- [5. Session Layer](#5-session-layer)
- [6. Presentation Layer](#6-presentation-layer)
- [7. Application Layer](#7-application-layer)
